#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## He (Shawn) Shuang

I'm a security researcher at Palo Alto Networks in the Bay Area, specializing in web security. My work focuses on detecting threats like phishing, malicious JavaScript, and browser plugins and greyware.
 
I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the University of Toronto advised by Prof David Lie. My research explored leveraging machine learning to enhance security and privacy across the web, systems, and applications. I also completed my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at the same university.
